This repository contains scripts to aggregate ([source/parse_test_report.R](source/parse_test_report.R)) results from [`{testthat}`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) and [`{covr}`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=covr) packages (see the workflow: [https://github.com/datashield/.github](https://github.com/datashield/.github)). There is a script to render ([source/render_docs.R](source/render_docs.R)) the results committed by the pipeline to the [logs/](logs/) directory. Also, a template for a Quarto report ([source/test_report.qmd](source/test_report.qmd)) to present the results of the tests in a dashboard.

The workflow follows the following stream:

`Repository with unit tests` >>> `Repository with results` >>> `GitHub pages`

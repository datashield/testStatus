This repository contains scripts to aggregate
([source/parse_test_report.R](%22source/parse_test_report.R%22)) results
from [`{testthat}`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) and
[`{covr}`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=covr) packages (see the
workflow: <https://github.com/datashield/.github>). There is a script to
render ([source/render_docs.R](%22source/render_docs.R%22)) the results
committed by the pipeline to the [logs/](logs/) directory. Also, a
template for a Quarto report
([source/test_report.qmd](source/test_report.qmd)) to present the
results of the tests in a dashboard.

The workflow follows the following stream:

`Repository with unit tests` \>\>\> `Repository with results` \>\>\>
`GitHub pages`
